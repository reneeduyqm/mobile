        <p>In this page, I will present my experiences that I mentioned in the main page. I went to Brookline, a small
            town near Boston for high school. My school is really nice with a great diversity and classes that I can get 
            to discover my intrsts and passion. Please let me know if you want to know more about studying and plans in
            high school! In my high school, I took visual art classes in which I developed my passion for ceramics. I 
            took performing art classes. I like dance even though I am not super good at it! I joined the fencing team,
            learned anatomy that I got the chance to dissecting a pig with my lab partner. Last but not least, under the 
            encouragement of my literature teacher, I start my journey in creative writing.  
        </p>
		<p>I joined the SSCC club which is a medical club for curing cancer. We held a lot of 
            activities and events to get donations for the people in need and went to different 
            research centers and hospitals to get to know more knowledge in additional to the 
            information we can learn through classes. As a club, we study and learn more about 
            mutations in cancer and the possible ways to cure and avoid.
